Let’s be real: passwords are a pain. As a developer, I juggle way too many admin
logins, testing environments, and random accounts. My old system? A
trusty-but-terrible text file buried somewhere in my system. Every time I needed
a password, I’d have to open it, search, copy, and paste. Over and over again.

It was dumb. I knew it was dumb. But I kept doing it… until one day, I snapped.

That’s when **NoKey – A Stupid Password Keeper** was born.

## 🤔 What is NoKey?

NoKey is a **lightweight Chrome/Edge extension** that helps you securely store
and manage login credentials—right inside your browser. It’s not fancy.
It’s not bloated with features you’ll never use. It’s just a quick and easy way
to save and retrieve passwords **without digging through files or notes**.

In short: NoKey does one thing, and it does it well—**keeping you from losing
your mind over passwords.**

## 🔨 Why I Built It

Like I said, my old workflow was… embarrassing.

- Open my *super-secure* `passwords.txt` file.
- Ctrl+F to find the right account.
- Copy and paste the username.
- Copy and paste the password.
- Hope I didn’t accidentally delete anything in the process.

Repeat. Every. Single. Time.

I knew I needed a **better way**—something lightweight, local, and stupidly
simple. That’s exactly what NoKey is.

## 🚀 How NoKey Works

It’s as simple as it gets:

1. Add your credentials inside NoKey’s interface.
2. Click to copy your username or password.
3. Paste it wherever you need.

That’s it. **No fluff, no distractions, just passwords on demand**.

## 💭 Final Thoughts

I didn’t set out to create the next big thing in password management. I just
wanted something **stupidly simple** that **made my life easier**. If you’ve ever
found yourself **Ctrl+F’ing** through a text file just to log in somewhere, NoKey
might save your sanity too.
