As a developer, I live in a world of logins, admin panels, and testing environments.

Every day, I have to log in to a dozen different places—some for work, some for
side projects, and some just because I forgot what I was doing and opened a new tab.

For the longest time, I used a good old TXT file to store my credentials.
Simple? Yes. Secure? Absolutely not. Convenient? Not even close.

Every time I needed a login, I’d:

1. Open my TXT file
2. Scroll through a chaotic mess of usernames and passwords
3. Copy the credentials
4. Paste them into the login page
5. Hope I didn’t accidentally copy/paste the wrong thing

It was a nightmare. And so, out of pure frustration, NoKey was born. 🎉

**NoKey** is a **lightweight browser extension** (for Chrome and Edge) that does one

within my browser. It’s like a **clipboard for logins**, minus the hassle.

## How NoKey Keeps It Simple (And Secure) 🔐

### 🚀 Local Storage = No Cloud, No Worries

NoKey **stores everything locally** in your browser’s IndexedDB. That means
**nothing gets sent over the internet**—no external servers, no creepy
third-party storage. Your credentials stay **on your machine, where they belong**.

### 🔄 Fast, Click-and-Copy Access
No more **CTRL+F** in a **TXT** file. Just open NoKey, find your saved login, and
**copy it instantly**. It’s so simple, it almost feels stupid (hence the name).

### 🚫 No Overcomplicated Features
No auto-fill. No password generation. No bloated UI. Just a **barebones, effective
tool** for developers who want their logins in one place—without the fuss.

## Why I Built It (And Why You Might Love It Too) ❤️

I didn’t create NoKey to be the next **1Password** or **Bitwarden**—this isn’t a
full-fledged password manager. It’s a **stupidly simple** solution to a very specific problem:

🔥 I just wanted a **quick, easy way to copy my credentials without searching for them**.

And guess what? **It works**. No more TXT files. No more headaches. Just a **tiny
extension that makes my day 10x easier**.
